# Day 6
This is a line intercepting a Parabola so you can use the quadratic equation to find the roots and then cound the distance between. 

## Niave
brute force it
## Slight better
if you didn't see you could use the quadratic equation you can compute until you find the first time that wins,
then realize that it's symetic, and compute the distance to the center and double it. 
## Best
