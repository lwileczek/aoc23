# Day 6
This is a pretty easy problem.
You can make it slightly faster by recognizing the symmetry and you only need to compute
until you find the first time that wins.
Overall, much easier than day5p2.

### Notes
You can save memory on p1 if you know the numbers will continue to be small.
You can sometimes see a speed-up of your program if you can use less memory
but these are so small it doens't matter.
